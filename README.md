# Predict-News-Category
Problem Statement: Predict the Categories of the news 
This application helps to predicts the categories of the news 

We live in a world of data and categorizing things becomes the understanding and
clarity about the things important and convenient when it is categorized on a particulate basis.
From the beginning, since the first printed newspaper, every news that makes it into a page
has had a specific section allotted to it. Although pretty much everything changed in
newspapers from the ink to the type of paper used. This often , this proper categorization of
news was carried over by generations and even to the digital versions of the newspaper.
Newspaper articles are not limited to a few topics or subjects So, in this project, we will
categorize news headlines based on the category of news like, for example, sports news, tech
news. In this project, Data Science, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing
techniques are used to predict which genre or category a piece of news will fall into from the
story. It is a classification problem.
